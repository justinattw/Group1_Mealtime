#### *Recreate Database*
The database can be re-created if (and only if) its contents needs to be overhauled (e.g. due to recipe changes). Creating the database requires scraping the whole of BBC Good Foods recipe list, which has a runtime of 10-15 minutes.

Caution: this will delete existing users.

1. Navigate to ```db``` directory
2. Delete ```mealtime.sqlite```
3. Run ```create_db.py```
